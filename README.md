# Qlink
  Qlink, a decentralized mobile network, dedicated to constructing an open-source telecom infrastructure on blockchain. 
  
# Qlink Chain
 The Qlink Chain is being developed specifically for the telecommunication industry, based on the industry’s unique requirements. 
 The Public Chain supports the registration of telecommunication infrastructure as digital assets in various scenarios, whilst the 
 Qlink Chain provides billing and operational support. 

## The Qlink Chain contains 
* Digital content: Fingerprints of digital content registered by content creators or IP owners.
* Data traffic billing information: Billing information based on users’ data usage on the Qlink network 
* Users visit records: Encrypted records of users’ browsing history 
 
  To accommodate the requirements of the mobile network business, the Qlink Chain will adopt a Delegated Proof-of-Stake consensus 
  algorithm to generate billing data and create a ledger of content accessed by users. This algorithm supports high frequency and
  concurrent transactions with low fees. Qlink users will be able to deploy smart contracts seamlessly between telcos, content producers,
  IoT terminals and enterprises. 

# QlinkDataNode
